# Personalized React Router

This project is a custom implementation of a React Router, designed to provide a lightweight and flexible routing solution tailored to specific project needs.

## Features

- **Custom Browser Router:** A personalized version of the React Router's BrowserRouter component, handling URL changes and navigation.
- **Custom Route Matching:** A custom Route component that matches the current URL to the specified paths and renders the corresponding components.
- **Simple Link Component:** A Link component to navigate between routes without reloading the page.
- **Integration with Tailwind CSS:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for styling, making the project easy to customize and extend.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-react-router.git
    cd personalized-react-router
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

This project includes a basic example of how to use the custom router with some predefined routes.

### Components

- **BrowserRouter:** Wraps the entire application to manage navigation and URL changes.
- **Route:** Renders the children components when the `path` prop matches the current URL.
- **Link:** A component for navigation that prevents full-page reloads.

### Example

```javascript
import BrowserRouter from "./BrowserRouter.jsx";
import Route from "./Route.jsx";
import NavBar from "./NavBar.jsx";

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <NavBar />
      <Route path="/home">
        <h3>Home Page</h3>
      </Route>
      <Route path="/blog">
        <h3>Blog Page</h3>
      </Route>
      <Route path="/about">
        <h3>About Page</h3>
      </Route>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
#### Customization
  You can easily extend this router by adding new routes, adjusting path matching logic, or integrating with other React libraries.
